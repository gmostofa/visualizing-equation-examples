# Visualizing Equations - Examples

This repository contains Unity project examples from **Visualizing Equations Vol 1** by Jettelly. The examples help visually understand mathematical concepts using Unityâ€™s `EditorWindow`.

## Content

- **Dot Product Visualization**
  - Understand vector relationships and visualize the dot product.
  
- **Cross Product Visualization**
  - Explore 3D vector relations and visualize cross products.

- **Quaternions and Rotations**
  - Learn quaternion-based rotations and visualize transformations.

- **Rotation Matrices & Euler Angles**
  - Understand 3D rotations and Euler angles, and avoid gimbal lock.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Access tools via the Editor Window in Unity.

## Requirements

- Unity 6000+
- Basic knowledge of C# and vector math
